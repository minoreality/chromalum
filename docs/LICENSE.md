# Scholarly Content License

The scholarly and explanatory content of this repository is licensed under the
**Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License** (CC BY 4.0).

This CC BY 4.0 content includes:

- the documents in this `docs/` directory (excluding this `LICENSE.md`
  itself, which is a license notice rather than scholarly content);
- the authored prose, labels, and section text displayed in the Theory tab;
- the rendered explanatory diagrams and theory visualizations displayed in
  the Theory tab.

The research-document set currently includes the core corpus and Music
Appendix listed below:

- `algebraic-color-model.md`
- `prior-art-algebraic-color-model.md`
- `theory-tab-prior-art-and-improvements.md`
- `music-linked-visualization.md`
- `prior-art-music-linked-visualization.md`

This is separate from the [MIT License](../LICENSE), which covers the
application source code, tests, build configuration, and non-scholarly app
assets. The React/TypeScript implementation of the Theory tab (component
logic, hooks, styles, and rendering algorithms) remains MIT-licensed. The
CC BY 4.0 license covers the expressive content surfaced by that
implementation: authored prose, section labels, and the rendered diagrams
when reused as visual artifacts (e.g., screenshots, embedded images).

## Summary (human-readable)

You are free to:

- **Share** — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format.
- **Adapt** — remix, transform, and build upon the material for any
  purpose, even commercially.

Under the following terms:

- **Attribution** — You must give appropriate credit, provide a link to
  the license, and indicate if changes were made. You may do so in any
  reasonable manner, but not in any way that suggests the licensor
  endorses you or your use.
- **No additional restrictions** — You may not apply legal terms or
  technological measures that legally restrict others from doing anything
  the license permits.

## Author

The CC BY 4.0 content is attributed to:

> **Doctor Chromaticus**

This is a pseudonymous attribution. Citations should use the name
verbatim — it is a mononym (no first/last name split), which has
implications for BibTeX entries (see the double-brace handling in the
template below).

## Core Corpus: _Tractatus Chromaticus_

The following three documents are collectively known as the _Tractatus
Chromaticus_ ("Chromatic Treatise"). They are read as three parts of a
single unified treatise on the discrete algebraic color model that underlies
the CHROMALUM application:

- **Pars I**: `algebraic-color-model.md`
  English title: Algebraic Color Model
  日本語タイトル: 離散代数的色彩モデル
- **Pars II**: `prior-art-algebraic-color-model.md`
  English title: Algebraic Color Model — Prior Art
  日本語タイトル: 離散代数的色彩モデル — 先行研究
- **Pars III**: `theory-tab-prior-art-and-improvements.md`
  English title: Theory Tab — Prior Art and Improvement Proposals
  日本語タイトル: Theoryタブ — 先行研究と改善提案

When citing the corpus as a whole, _Tractatus Chromaticus_ is the
collective title. When citing a specific part, use the document title
above and identify the corpus with _in Tractatus Chromaticus_.

## Music Appendix

The following two documents are companion notes to the core corpus. They
extend the same discrete algebraic color model into LinkedVisualization and
sonification, but they are not additional parts of _Tractatus Chromaticus_:

- **Appendix A**: `music-linked-visualization.md`
  English title: Music-Linked Visualization
  日本語タイトル: Music-Linked Visualization
- **Appendix B**: `prior-art-music-linked-visualization.md`
  English title: Music-Linked Visualization — Prior Art and Design Notes
  日本語タイトル: Music-Linked Visualization — 先行研究と設計ノート

When citing a Music Appendix note, use the document title above and identify
it as a CHROMALUM Music Appendix note.

## Theory Tab Content

The Theory tab is the interactive presentation layer of the same scholarly
content. Its authored prose, labels, explanatory annotations, and rendered
theory diagrams are licensed under CC BY 4.0 when reused as content. The
software implementation that renders them remains under the repository's MIT
License.

When citing the Theory tab as a whole, use **CHROMALUM Theory Tab** as the
title. When citing a specific section or figure, use that section or figure
title and identify it as part of the CHROMALUM Theory Tab.

## How to Cite

Attribution under CC BY 4.0 must include four elements (TASL):

- **T**itle of the work (use the specific document title from the lists
  above; _Tractatus Chromaticus_ for the core corpus; _CHROMALUM Music
  Appendix_ for the Music companion notes; _CHROMALUM Theory Tab_ for the
  interactive Theory tab)
- **A**uthor: Doctor Chromaticus
- **S**ource URL: <https://github.com/humannnnn1-bot/chromalum>
- **L**icense: CC BY 4.0,
  <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>

If you adapt, translate, abridge, or otherwise modify the material,
you must also indicate that changes were made.

The templates below cover the most common cases. Use whichever fits
your medium; equivalents in other styles are fine as long as the four
TASL elements are present.

the mononym into "first name / last name"):

For Music Appendix notes, replace `booktitle` / corpus wording with
`CHROMALUM Music Appendix` and use the specific appendix title.

- Applying additional legal or technological restrictions (e.g. DRM)
  that prevent downstream users from exercising the same CC BY 4.0
  rights.

Trademarks, logos, and product names (including "CHROMALUM") are not
