# Research Documentation

This directory contains the research and explanatory documentation for
CHROMALUM. The application source code is licensed under MIT; the scholarly

## Core Corpus: Tractatus Chromaticus

The core corpus is the three-part _Tractatus Chromaticus_ ("Chromatic
Treatise"). These documents define the discrete algebraic color model, place
it against prior art, and explain how it is presented in the Theory tab.

1. [Pars I - Algebraic Color Model](./algebraic-color-model.md)  
   Defines the 8-color `GF(2)^3` model, luma ordering, complement theorem,
   Fano/Hamming correspondences, and polyhedral readings.
2. [Pars II - Algebraic Color Model - Prior Art](./prior-art-algebraic-color-model.md)  
   Separates known mathematical and color-model structures from the
   CHROMALUM-specific synthesis.
3. [Pars III - Theory Tab - Prior Art and Improvement Proposals](./theory-tab-prior-art-and-improvements.md)  
   Tracks how the theoretical model is presented in the interactive Theory
   tab, including claim boundaries and UI/content improvements.

## Music Appendix

The Music Appendix extends the same model into LinkedVisualization and
sonification. These notes are companion documents to the core corpus rather
than additional parts of _Tractatus Chromaticus_.

1. [Appendix A - Music-Linked Visualization](./music-linked-visualization.md)  
   Describes the luma-radius hue graph, alpha rotation, complement phase
   behavior, pitch mapping, and bit-spectrum timbre layer.
2. [Appendix B - Music-Linked Visualization — 先行研究と設計ノート](./prior-art-music-linked-visualization.md)  
   Surveys related sonification, color-to-sound, luma, hue, and accessibility
   references, and records design guidance for the Music tab.

## Suggested Reading Order

For the theory model, read Pars I first, then Pars II, then Pars III. For the
Music tab and LinkedVisualization, read Pars I first, then Appendix A, then
Appendix B.
